To make sure my code or program is functional and secure, I test it often and check for any mistakes or issues. I also try to follow good coding practices to keep it safe and reliable.

When figuring out user needs, I listen to what they want and think about how to make the program easier to use. I focus on what will help the user the most and try to include that in the design.

When designing software, I plan out what it should do before I start coding. I break the project into smaller parts and make sure everything works together smoothly.
